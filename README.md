# Robotics_Project
This is my final year robotics project where I developed a 4 DOF (+1) robot to manipulate chess pieces. Kinematic approaches were used to manipulate chess pieces, and transformations between joint and task spaces were used in order to determine where chess pieces needed to be moved. Control systems were also used to force the robotic limb to only allow movement in certain axis'.
